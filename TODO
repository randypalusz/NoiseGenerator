Create base abstract class (called something like Generator)
    - other classes will inherit from this
        - i.e. WaveFunctionCollapse : public Generator
    - virtual method named run() that will run the algorithm to completion.
        - think about starting this from a thread, where the algorithm will write to a vector in the Display class containing the display information, and the Display class will read from it and display based on the vector
